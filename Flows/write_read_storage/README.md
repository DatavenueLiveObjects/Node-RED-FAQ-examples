## Flow description

This flow showcases using the Node-RED storage.

Node-RED file storage, together with Context storage, is a persitent data retaining mechanism.

> ***Disclaimer***
>
>For most usecases it is recommended to use the **Context storage**.
>
>Use file storage primarily to upload files to your flow and store blob-formatted data.

As a Node-RED SaaS subscriber, you get a private and isolated storage space with your Node-RED tenant. That means you can persistently store files generated by your flows.

### Write
To write data to storage use `write file` node. The node appends or overwrites `msg.payload` to file. A file can be also deleted.

Another way to upload data to Node-RED storage is via the Upload button on the Dashboard. In order to do that, go to your **Dashboard** and choose **File uploader** tab.

### Read
To read data from a file use `read file` node. It outputs the file content to `msg.payload`. Then, by applying a debug node at output, you are able to view and copy the data to clipboard.
