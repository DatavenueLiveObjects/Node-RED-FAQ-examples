## Flow description

This flow showcases using the **context storage** built in Node-RED.

Context is the recommended way of retaining data intercepted or generated by Node-RED.

### When to use context?
Use context when you want your data to **always persist** (even after restart or crash of your Node-RED instance).

Context saves data in file storage instead of memory.

### Context scopes
There are three context scopes:
- Node context - shared within a single node
- Flow context - shared by nodes within one flow (tab)
- Global context - shared by all nodes in all flows

### Use context with function node
Although you can easily use context with a *Change node*, sometimes you may want to keep your logic in a *Function node*.

To save data in global context use `global.set("yourVariableName",data)`.

To retrieve data from global context use `global.get("yourVariableName")`.
